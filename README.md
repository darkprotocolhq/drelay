# dRelay 🦀

A blazing fast (🔥) asynchronous shielded transaction relayer for the dark-protocol-legacy program. Written entirely in rust utilising actix-web, redis-rs, tokio and solana-sdk/client. Designed to offer a robust and long-lasting legacy solution for anonymity relaying on the solana network. 


### 🚧🏗️ In Development
dRelay is in active-development and thus is not live for production environment. This will require rigorous testing and multiple request-for-comments (RFC) before going live. dRelay is based entirely on a test-environment version of the original Light Protocol Relayer which can be found below.
#### 🗼 Access production relayer (TypeScript)

The production relayer can be found in the repository below - running will require some understanding of the base arch in order to efficiently setup and monitor the relayer through-out its existence.
